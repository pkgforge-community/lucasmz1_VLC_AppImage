# VLC_AppImage

Before runin the app to playback your videos run this comando first
`./VLC_media_player-x86_64.AppImage --reset-plugins-cache`
this command will reset the vlc plugin chache to avoid you get so many plugings warning on the console if you use it to run apps.
<br>Due to an issue for some linux user that uses vlc in puppy linux I made a modification in vlc that is possible to make vlc to run in systems that the normal user is root, those systems are like Puppy Linux and others.<br/>
